 ------- -----------  ---------- -----------
  1.5.0   K Hoang      27/03/2020 Initial coding to support other boards besides Nano-33 IoT, MKRWIFI1010, MKRVIDOR4000, etc.
                                  such as Arduino Mega, Teensy, SAMD21, SAMD51, STM32, etc
  1.5.1   K Hoang      22/04/2020 Add support to nRF52 boards, such as AdaFruit Feather nRF52832, nRF52840 Express, BlueFruit Sense, 
                                  Itsy-Bitsy nRF52840 Express, Metro nRF52840 Express, etc.         
  1.5.2   K Hoang      09/05/2020 Port FirmwareUpdater to permit nRF52 boards to update W102 firmware and SSL certs on IDE   
                                  Update default pin-outs.
