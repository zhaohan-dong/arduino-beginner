  WiFiChatServer.ino

  A simple server that distributes any incoming messages to all
  connected clients.  To use telnet to  your device's IP address and type.
  You can see the client's input in the serial monitor as well.

  This example is written for a network using WPA encryption. For
  WEP or WPA, change the Wifi.begin() call accordingly.


  Circuit:
   Board with NINA module (Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, MKR VIDOR 4000 and UNO WiFi Rev.2)

  Based on and modified from WiFiNINA libarary https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiNINA
  to support other boards besides Nano-33 IoT, MKRWIFI1010, MKRVIDOR4000, etc.

 ------- -----------  ---------- -----------
  1.5.0   K Hoang      27/03/2020 Initial coding to support other boards besides Nano-33 IoT, MKRWIFI1010, MKRVIDOR4000, etc.
                                  such as Arduino Mega, Teensy, SAMD21, SAMD51, STM32, etc
  1.5.1   K Hoang      22/04/2020 Add support to nRF52 boards, such as AdaFruit Feather nRF52832, nRF52840 Express, BlueFruit Sense, 
                                  Itsy-Bitsy nRF52840 Express, Metro nRF52840 Express, etc.         
  1.5.2   K Hoang      09/05/2020 Port FirmwareUpdater to permit nRF52 boards to update W102 firmware and SSL certs on IDE   
                                  Update default pin-outs.
