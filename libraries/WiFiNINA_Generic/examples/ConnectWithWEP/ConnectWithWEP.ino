  ConnectWithWEP.ino

  This example connects to a WEP-encrypted Wifi network.
  Then it prints the  MAC address of the Wifi module,
  the IP address obtained, and other network details.

  If you use 40-bit WEP, you need a key that is 10 characters long,
  and the characters must be hexadecimal (0-9 or A-F).
  e.g.  for 40-bit, ABBADEAF01 will work, but ABBADEAF won't work
  (too short) and ABBAISDEAF won't work (I and S are not
  hexadecimal characters).

  For 128-bit, you need a string that is 26 characters long.
  D0D0DEADF00DABBADEAFBEADED will work because it's 26 characters,
  all in the 0-9, A-F range.
